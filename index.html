    <h1> Inside Ohio Counties, Youth Suicides Abound </h1>

    <h2> With mental health policies sometimes left to the state, and other times as local as school boards, some parents are at a loss when suicide enters their family.

    <p> Inside Ohio's Southwest suburbs, Anderson Township is where Friday night lights rule and stigmas flourish. </p>

<p> For the town of nearly 44,000 mostly split between two high schools, there has been an unnerving trend for parents uniting and simultaneoulsy splitting the community, youth suicides. </p>

<p> Forest Hills School District, which has nealry 7,000 students in Anderson Township, experienced seven suicides in one four year period ending in 2021. Many greiving parents in the district have turned to anti-stigma activism following their losses, as there is a 'don't talk about it' mentality ingrained within the district, like many Midwest suburbs.</p>

<p> Long before many of Ohio's anti-stigma organization's ignited their work, Dr. Heather Stuart, the Bell Canada Chair in Mental Health and Anti-stigma Research, was deeply embedded in suicide stigma research. 
    </p>

<p> “If you think that something is happening frequently, it can normalize it for you,” Dr. Stuart said. “So, If you’re a person with mental illness, and you know that more and more people are using [suicide], then maybe you’ll consider it too.”  </p>
